      "Test Document (Lisp (programming language) at 8213): Â«lisp historically lisp is family of computer programming languages with long history and distinctive fully parenthesized prefix notation originally specified in lisp is the second oldest high level programming language in widespread use today only fortran is older by one year lisp has changed since its early days and many dialects have existed over its history today the best known general purpose lisp dialects are clojure common lisp and scheme lisp was originally created as practical mathematical notation for computer programs influenced by the notation of alonzo church lambda calculus it quickly became the favored programming language for artificial intelligence ai research as one of the earliest programming languages lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science including tree data structures automatic storage management dynamic typing conditionals higher order functions recursion the self hosting compiler and the read eval print loop the name lisp derives from list processor linked lists are one of lisp major data structures and lisp source code is made of lists thus lisp programs can manipulate source code as data structure giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain specific languages embedded in lisp the of code and data gives lisp its instantly recognizable syntax all program code is written as expressions or parenthesized lists function call or syntactic form is written as list with the function or operator name first and the arguments following for instance function that takes three arguments would be called as history john mccarthy developed lisp in while he was at the massachusetts institute of technology mit mccarthy published its design in paper in communications of the acm in entitled recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine part he showed that with few simple operators and notation for functions one can build turing complete language for algorithms information processing language was the first ai language from or and already included many of the concepts such as list processing and recursion which came to be used in lisp mccarthy original notation used bracketed expressions that would be translated into expressions as an example the expression is equivalent to the expression once lisp was implemented programmers rapidly chose to use expressions and expressions were abandoned expressions surfaced again with short lived attempts of mlisp by horace enea and cgol by vaughan pratt lisp was first implemented by steve russell on an ibm computer russell had read mccarthy paper and realized to mccarthy surprise that the lisp eval function could be implemented in machine code according to what reported by paul graham in hackers painters mccarthy said steve russell said look why don program this eval and said to him ho ho you re confusing theory with practice this eval is intended for reading not for computing but he went ahead and did it that is he compiled the eval in my paper into ibm machine code fixing bug and then advertised this as lisp interpreter which it certainly was so at that point lisp had essentially the form that it has today the result was working lisp interpreter which could be used to run lisp programs or more properly evaluate lisp expressions two assembly language macros for the ibm became the primitive operations for decomposing lists contents of the address part of register number and contents of the decrement part of register number where register is used to refer to registers of the computer central processing unit cpu lisp dialects still use and and for the operations that return the first item in list and the rest of the list respectively the first complete lisp compiler written in lisp was implemented in by tim hart and mike levin at mit this compiler introduced the lisp model of incremental compilation in which compiled and interpreted functions can intermix freely the language used in hart and levin memo is much closer to modern lisp style than mccarthy earlier code lisp was difficult system to implement with the compiler techniques and stock hardware of the garbage collection routines developed by mit graduate student daniel edwards made it practical to run lisp on general purpose computing systems but efficiency was still problem this led to the creation of lisp machines dedicated hardware for running lisp environments and programs during the and great effort was made to unify the work on new lisp dialects mostly successors to maclisp such as zetalisp and nil new implementation of lisp into single language the new language common lisp was somewhat compatible with the dialects it replaced the book common lisp the language notes the compatibility of various constructs in ansi published the common lisp standard ansi information technology programming language common lisp timeline connection to artificial intelligence since inception lisp was closely connected with the artificial intelligence research community especially on pdp the bit word size of the pdp pdp was influenced by the usefulness of having two lisp bit pointers in single word systems lisp was used as the implementation of the programming language micro planner which was used in the famous ai system shrdlu in the as ai research spawned commercial offshoots the performance of existing lisp systems became growing issue genealogy and variants over its sixty year history lisp has spawned many variations on the core theme of an expression language moreover each given dialect may have several implementations for instance there are more than dozen implementations of common lisp differences between dialects may be quite visible for instance common lisp uses the keyword defun to name function but scheme uses define common lisp defun scheme define lambda or define within dialect that is standardized however conforming implementations support the same core language but with different extensions and libraries historically significant dialects thumb right lisp machine in the mit museum thumb bsd from the university of wisconsin displaying the man page for franz lisp lisp accessed may first implementation lisp first widely distributed version developed by mccarthy and others at mit so named because it contained several improvements on the original lisp interpreter but was not major restructuring as the planned lisp would be stanford lisp this was successor to lisp developed at the stanford ai lab and widely distributed to pdp systems running the tops operating system it was rendered obsolete by maclisp and interlisp maclisp developed for mit project mac no relation to apple macintosh nor to mccarthy direct descendant of lisp it ran on the pdp and multics systems maclisp would later come to be called maclisp and is often referred to as maclisp interlisp developed at bbn technologies for pdp systems running the tenex operating system later adopted as west coast lisp for the xerox lisp machines as interlisp small version called interlisp was published for the based atari bit family computer line for quite some time maclisp and interlisp were strong competitors franz lisp originally university of california berkeley project later developed by franz inc the name is humorous deformation of the name franz liszt and does not refer to allegro common lisp the dialect of common lisp sold by franz inc in more recent years xlisp which autolisp was based on standard lisp and portable standard lisp were widely used and ported especially with the computer algebra system reduce zetalisp also termed lisp machine lisp used on the lisp machines direct descendant of maclisp

lisp or goal is video game programming language developed by andy gavin and the jak and daxter team at naughty dog it was written using allegro common lisp and used in the development of the entire jak and daxter series of games to present after having declined somewhat in the lisp has experienced resurgence of interest after most new activity has been focused around implementations of common lisp scheme emacs lisp clojure and racket and includes development of new portable libraries and applications many new lisp programmers were inspired by writers such as paul graham and eric raymond to pursue language others considered antiquated new lisp programmers often describe the language as an eye opening experience and claim to be substantially more productive than in other languages this increase in awareness may be contrasted to the ai winter and lisp brief gain in the mid dan weinreb lists in his survey of common lisp implementations eleven actively maintained common lisp implementations scieneer common lisp is new commercial implementation forked from cmucl with first release in the open source community has created new supporting infrastructure cliki is wiki that

bot written in lisp planet lisp collects the contents of various lisp related blogs on lispforum users discuss lisp topics lispjobs is service for announcing job offers and there is weekly news service weekly lisp news common lisp net is hosting site for open source common lisp projects quicklisp is library manager for common lisp fifty years of lisp was celebrated at lisp oopsla there are regular local user meetings in boston vancouver and hamburg other events include the european common lisp meeting the european lisp symposium and an international lisp conference the scheme community actively maintains over twenty implementations several significant new implementations chicken gambit gauche ikarus larceny ypsilon have been developed in the decade the revised report on the algorithmic language schemedocuments standards rs schemers org retrieved on standard of scheme was widely accepted in the scheme community the scheme requests for implementation process has created lot of quasi standard libraries and extensions for scheme user communities of individual scheme implementations continue to grow new language standardization process was started in and led to the rs scheme standard in academic use of scheme for teaching computer science seems to have declined somewhat some universities are no longer using scheme in their computer science introductory courses mit now uses python instead of scheme for its undergraduate computer science program and mitx massive open online course there are several new dialects of lisp arc hy nu liskell and lfe lisp flavored erlang the parser for julia is implemented in femtolisp dialect of scheme julia is inspired by scheme and is often considered lisp major dialects common lisp and scheme represent two major streams of lisp development these languages embody significantly different design choices common lisp is successor to maclisp the primary influences were lisp machine lisp maclisp nil lisp spice lisp and scheme chapter history ansi cl standard it has many of the features of lisp machine lisp large lisp dialect used to program lisp machines but was designed to be efficiently implementable on any personal computer or workstation common lisp is general purpose programming language and thus has large language standard including many built in data types functions macros and other language elements and an object system common lisp object system common lisp also borrowed certain features from scheme such as lexical scoping and lexical closures common lisp implementations are available for targeting different platforms such as the llvm clasp is common lisp implementation that interoperates with and uses llvm for just in time compilation jit to native code the java virtual machine armed bear common lisp abcl is full implementation of the common lisp language featuring both an interpreter and compiler running in the jvm powerpc alpha arm motorola and mips common lisp implementations survey and operating systems such as windows macos linux solaris freebsd netbsd openbsd dragonfly bsd and heroku comparison of actively developed common lisp implementations scheme is statically scoped and properly tail recursive dialect of the lisp programming language invented by guy steele jr and gerald jay sussman it was designed to have exceptionally clear and simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions designed about decade earlier than common lisp scheme is more minimalist design it has much smaller set of standard features but with certain implementation features such as tail call optimization and full continuations not specified in common lisp wide variety of programming paradigms including imperative functional and message passing styles find convenient expression in scheme scheme continues to evolve with series of standards revisedn report on the algorithmic language scheme and series of scheme requests for implementation clojure is recent dialect of lisp that targets mainly the java virtual machine and the common language runtime clr the python vm the ruby vm yarv and compiling to javascript it is designed to be pragmatic general purpose language clojure draws considerable influences from haskell and places very strong emphasis on immutability an in depth look at clojure collections retrieved clojure provides access to java frameworks and libraries with optional type hints and type inference so that calls to java can avoid reflection and enable fast primitive operations further lisp dialects are used as scripting languages in many applications with the best known being emacs lisp in the emacs editor autolisp and later visual lisp in autocad nyquist in audacity scheme in lilypond the potential small size of useful scheme interpreter makes it particularly popular for embedded scripting examples include siod and tinyscheme both of which have been successfully embedded in the gimp image processor under the generic name script fu script fu in gimp retrieved librep lisp interpreter by john harper originally based on the emacs lisp language has been embedded in the sawfish window manager librep at sawfish wikia retrieved language innovations lisp was the first language where the structure of program code is represented faithfully and directly in standard data structure quality much later dubbed homoiconicity thus lisp functions can be manipulated altered or even created within lisp program without lower level manipulations this is generally considered one of the main advantages of the language with regard to its expressive power and makes the language suitable for syntactic macros and metacircular evaluation conditional using an if then else syntax was invented by mccarthy in fortran context he proposed its inclusion in algol but it was not made part of the algol specification for lisp mccarthy used the more general cond structure algol took up if then else and popularized it lisp deeply influenced alan kay the leader of the research team that developed smalltalk at xerox parc and in turn lisp was influenced by smalltalk with later dialects adopting object oriented programming features inheritance classes encapsulating instances message passing etc in the the flavors object system introduced the concept of multiple inheritance and the mixin the common lisp object system provides multiple inheritance multimethods with multiple dispatch and first class generic functions yielding flexible and powerful form of dynamic dispatch it has served as the template for many subsequent lisp including scheme object systems which are often implemented via metaobject protocol reflective metacircular design in which the object system is defined in terms of itself lisp was only the second language after smalltalk and is still one of the very few languages to possess such metaobject system many years later alan kay suggested that as result of the confluence of these features only smalltalk and lisp could be regarded as properly conceived object oriented programming systems lisp introduced the concept of automatic garbage collection in which the system walks the heap looking for unused memory progress in modern sophisticated garbage collection algorithms such as generational garbage collection was stimulated by its use in lisp edsger dijkstra in his turing award lecture said with few very basic principles at its foundation it lisp has shown remarkable stability besides that lisp has been the carrier for considerable number of in sense our most sophisticated computer applications lisp has jokingly been described as the most intelligent way to misuse computer think that description great compliment because it transmits the full flavour of liberation it has assisted number of our most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts acm turing award lecture largely because of its resource requirements with respect to early computing hardware including early microprocessors lisp did not become as popular outside of the ai community as fortran and the algol descended language because of its suitability to complex and dynamic applications lisp is enjoying some resurgence of popular interest in the syntax and semantics note this article examples are written in common lisp though most are also valid in scheme symbolic expressions expressions lisp is an expression oriented language unlike most other languages no distinction is made between expressions and statements all code and data are written as expressions when an expression is evaluated it produces value in common lisp possibly multiple values which can then be embedded into other expressions each value can be any data type mccarthy paper introduced two types of syntax symbolic expressions expressions sexps which mirror the internal representation of code and data and meta expressions expressions which express functions of expressions expressions never found favor and almost all lisps today use expressions to manipulate both code and data the use of parentheses is lisp most immediately obvious difference from other programming language families as result students have long given lisp nicknames such as lost in stupid parentheses or lots of irritating superfluous parentheses however the expression syntax is also responsible for much of lisp power the syntax is extremely regular which facilitates manipulation by computer however the syntax of lisp is not limited to traditional parentheses notation it can be extended to include alternative notations for example xmlisp is common lisp extension that employs the metaobject protocol to integrate expressions with the extensible markup language xml the reliance on expressions gives the language great flexibility because lisp functions are written as lists they can be processed exactly like data this allows easy writing of programs which manipulate other programs metaprogramming many lisp dialects exploit this feature using macro systems which enables extension of the language almost without limit lists lisp list is written with its elements separated by whitespace and surrounded by parentheses for example is list whose elements are the three atoms and these values are implicitly typed they are respectively two integers and lisp specific data type called symbol and do not have to be declared as such the empty list is also represented as the special atom this is the only entity in lisp which is both an atom and list expressions are written as lists using prefix notation the first element in the list is the name of function the name of macro lambda expression or the name of special operator see below the remainder of the list are the arguments for example the function returns its arguments as list so the expression list quote foo evaluates to the list the quote before the in the preceding example is special operator which returns its argument without evaluating it any unquoted expressions are recursively evaluated before the enclosing expression is evaluated for example list list evaluates to the list note that the third argument is list lists can be nested operators arithmetic operators are treated similarly the expression evaluates to the equivalent under infix notation would be lisp has no notion of operators as implemented in algol derived languages arithmetic operators in lisp are variadic functions or ary able to take any number of arguments style increment operator is sometimes implemented under the name incf giving syntax incf equivalent to setq returning the new value of special operators sometimes called special forms provide lisp control structure for example the special operator takes three arguments if the first argument is non nil it evaluates to the second argument otherwise it evaluates to the third argument thus the expression if nil list foo list bar evaluates to of course this would be more useful if non trivial expression had been substituted in place of lisp also provides logical operators and or and not the and and or operators do short circuit evaluation and will return their first nil and non nil argument respectively or and zero nil never james task time will evaluate to james lambda expressions and function definition another special operator is used to bind variables to values which are then evaluated within an expression this operator is also used to create functions the arguments to are list of arguments and the expression or expressions to which the function evaluates the returned value is the value of the last expression that is evaluated the expression lambda arg arg evaluates to function that when applied takes one argument binds it to and returns the number one greater than that argument lambda expressions are treated no differently from named functions they are invoked the same way therefore the expression lambda arg arg evaluates to here we re doing function application we execute the anonymous function by passing to it the value named functions are created by storing lambda expression in symbol using the defun macro defun foo defines new function named in the global environment it is conceptually similar to the expression setf fdefinition lambda block atoms in the original lisp there were two fundamental data types atoms and lists list was finite ordered sequence of elements where each element is either an atom or list and an atom was number or symbol symbol was essentially unique named item written as an alphanumeric string in source code and used either as variable name or as data item in symbolic processing for example the list contains three elements the symbol the list and the number the essential difference between atoms and lists was that atoms were immutable and unique two atoms that appeared in different places in source code but were written in exactly the same way represented the same object whereas each list was separate object that could be altered independently of other lists and could be distinguished from other lists by comparison operators as more data types were introduced in later lisp dialects and programming styles evolved the concept of an atom lost importance many dialects still retained the predicate atom for legacy compatibility defining it true for any object which is not cons conses and lists thumb right px box and pointer diagram for the list lisp list is implemented as singly linked list each cell of this list is called cons in scheme pair and is composed of two pointers called the car and cdr these are respectively equivalent to the and fields discussed in the article linked list of the many data structures that can be built out of cons cells one of the most basic is called proper list proper list is either the special empty list symbol or cons in which the points to datum which may be another cons structure such as list and the points to another proper list if given cons is taken to be the head of linked list then its car points to the first element of the list and its cdr points to the rest of the list for this reason the and functions are also called and when referring to conses which are part of linked list rather than say tree thus lisp list is not an atomic object as an instance of container class in or java would be list is nothing more than an aggregate of linked conses variable which refers to given list is simply pointer to the first cons in the list traversal of list can be done by cdring down the list that is taking successive cdrs to visit each cons of the list or by using any of several higher order functions to map function over list because conses and lists are so universal in lisp systems it is common misconception that they are lisp only data structures in fact all but the most simplistic lisps have other data structures such as vectors arrays hash tables structures and so forth expressions represent lists parenthesized expressions represent linked list structures there are several ways to represent the same list as an expression cons can be written in dotted pair notation as where is the car and the cdr longer proper list might be written in dotted pair notation this is conventionally abbreviated as in list notation an improper listnb so called dotted list is only one kind of improper list the other kind is the circular list where the cons cells form loop typically this is represented using to represent the target cons cell that will have multiple references and is used to refer to this cons for instance would normally be printed as without circular structure printing enabled but makes the reuse of the cons cell clear cannot normally be printed as it is circular although is sometimes displayed the cdr of the cons cell defined by is itself may be written in combination of the two as for the list of three conses whose last cdr is the list in fully specified form list processing procedures lisp provides many built in procedures for accessing and controlling lists lists can be created directly with the procedure which takes any number of arguments and returns the list of these arguments list output list output because of the way that lists are constructed from cons pairs the procedure can be used to add an element to the front of list note that the procedure is asymmetric in how it handles list arguments because of how lists are constructed cons output cons output the procedure appends two or more lists to one another because lisp lists are linked lists appending two lists has asymptotic time complexity append output append output shared structure lisp lists being simple linked lists can share structure with one another that is to say two lists can have the same tail or final sequence of conses for instance after the execution of the following common lisp code setf foo list setf bar cons cdr foo the lists and are and respectively however the tail is the same structure in both lists it is not copy the cons cells pointing to and are in the same memory locations for both lists sharing structure rather than copying can give dramatic performance improvement however this technique can interact in undesired ways with functions that alter lists passed to them as arguments altering one list such as by replacing the with will affect the other setf third foo goose this changes to but thereby also changes to possibly unexpected result this can be source of bugs and functions which alter their arguments are documented as destructive for this very reason aficionados of functional programming avoid destructive functions in the scheme dialect which favors the functional style the names of destructive functions are marked with cautionary exclamation point or bang such as read set car bang which replaces the car of cons in the common lisp dialect destructive functions are commonplace the equivalent of is named for replace car this function is rarely seen however as common lisp includes special facility to make it easier to define and use destructive functions frequent style in common lisp is to write code functionally without destructive calls when prototyping then to add destructive calls as an optimization where it is safe to do so self evaluating forms and quoting lisp evaluates expressions which are entered by the user symbols and lists evaluate to some other usually simpler expression for instance symbol evaluates to the value of the variable it names evaluates to however most other forms evaluate to themselves if entering into lisp it returns any expression can also be marked to prevent it from being evaluated as is necessary for symbols and lists this is the role of the special operator or its abbreviation one quotation mark for instance usually if entering the symbol it returns the value of the corresponding variable or an error if there is no such variable to refer to the literal symbol enter or usually both common lisp and scheme also support the backquote operator termed quasiquote in scheme entered with the character grave accent this is almost the same as the plain quote except it allows expressions to be evaluated and their values interpolated into quoted list with the comma unquote and comma at splice operators if the variable has the value then evaluates to while evaluates to the backquote is most often used in defining macro expansions quasiquotation in lisp alan bawden self evaluating forms and quoted forms are lisp equivalent of literals it may be possible to modify the values of mutable literals in program code for instance if function returns quoted form and the code that calls the function modifies the form this may alter the behavior of the function on subsequent iterations defun should be constant one two three let stuff should be constant setf third stuff bizarre bad should be constant returns one two bizarre modifying quoted form like this is generally considered bad style and is defined by ansi common lisp as erroneous resulting in undefined behavior in compiled files because the file compiler can coalesce similar constants put them in write protected memory etc lisp formalization of quotation has been noted by douglas hofstadter in gÃ¶del escher bach and others as an example of the philosophical idea of self reference scope and closure the lisp family splits over the use of dynamic or static lexical scope clojure common lisp and scheme make use of static scoping by default while newlisp picolisp and the embedded languages in emacs and autocad use dynamic scoping since version emacs uses both dynamic and lexical scoping list structure of program code exploitation by macros and compilers fundamental distinction between lisp and other languages is that in lisp the textual representation of program is simply human readable description of the same internal data structures linked lists symbols number characters etc as would be used by the underlying lisp system lisp uses this to implement very powerful macro system like other macro languages such as macro returns code that can then be compiled however unlike macros the macros are lisp functions and so can exploit the full power of lisp further because lisp code has the same structure as lists macros can be built with any of the list processing functions in the language in short anything that lisp can do to data structure lisp macros can do to code in contrast in most other languages the parser output is purely internal to the language implementation and cannot be manipulated by the programmer this feature makes it easy to develop efficient languages within languages for example the common lisp object system can be implemented cleanly as language extension using macros this means that if an application needs different inheritance mechanism it can use different object system this is in stark contrast to most other languages for example java does not support multiple inheritance and there is no reasonable way to add it in simplistic lisp implementations this list structure is directly interpreted to run the program function is literally piece of list structure which is traversed by the interpreter in executing it however most substantial lisp systems also include compiler the compiler translates list structure into machine code or bytecode for execution this code can run as fast as code compiled in conventional languages such as macros expand before the compilation step and thus offer some interesting options if program needs precomputed table then macro might create the table at compile time so the compiler need only output the table and need not call code to create the table at run time some lisp implementations even have mechanism eval when that allows code to be present during compile time when macro would need it but not present in the emitted module time of evaluation common lisp extensions gnu org retrieved on evaluation and the read eval print loop lisp languages are often used with an interactive command line which may be combined with an integrated development environment ide the user types in expressions at the command line or directs the ide to transmit them to the lisp system lisp reads the entered expressions evaluates them and prints the result for this reason the lisp command line is called read eval print loop repl the basic operation of the repl is as follows this is simplistic description which omits many elements of real lisp such as quoting and macros the function accepts textual expressions as input and parses them into an internal data structure for instance if you type the text at the prompt translates this into linked list with three elements the symbol the number and the number it so happens that this list is also valid piece of lisp code that is it can be evaluated this is because the car of the list names function the addition operation note that will be read as single symbol will be read as the number one hundred and twenty three will be read as the string the function evaluates the data returning zero or more other lisp data as result evaluation does not have to mean interpretation some lisp systems compile every expression to native machine code it is simple however to describe evaluation as interpretation to evaluate list whose car names function first evaluates each of the arguments given in its cdr then applies the function to the arguments in this case the function is addition and applying it to the argument list yields the answer this is the result of the evaluation the symbol evaluates to the value of the symbol foo data like the string evaluates to the same string the list evaluates to the list it is the job of the function to represent output to the user for simple result such as this is trivial an expression which evaluated to piece of list structure would require that traverse the list and print it out as an expression to implement lisp repl it is necessary only to implement these three functions and an infinite loop function naturally the implementation of will be complex since it must also implement all special operators like or this done basic repl is one line of code the lisp repl typically also provides input editing an input history error handling and an interface to the debugger lisp is usually evaluated eagerly in common lisp arguments are evaluated in applicative order leftmost innermost while in scheme order of arguments is undefined leaving room for optimization by compiler control structures lisp originally had very few control structures but many more were added during the language evolution lisp original conditional operator is the precursor to later structures programmers in the scheme dialect often express loops using tail recursion scheme commonality in academic computer science has led some students to believe that tail recursion is the only or the most common way to write iterations in lisp but this is incorrect all oft seen lisp dialects have imperative style iteration constructs from scheme loop to common lisp complex expressions moreover the key issue that makes this an objective rather than subjective matter is that scheme makes specific requirements for the handling of tail calls and thus the reason that the use of tail recursion is generally encouraged for scheme is that the practice is expressly supported by the language definition by contrast ansi common lisp does not require semantic constraints in common lisp hyperspec the optimization commonly termed tail call elimination thus the fact that tail recursive style as casual replacement for the use of more traditional iteration constructs such as or is discouraged control abstraction recursion vs iteration in tutorial on good lisp programming style by kent pitman and peter norvig august in common lisp is not just matter of stylistic preference but potentially one of efficiency since an apparent tail call in common lisp may not compile as simple jump and program correctness since tail recursion may increase stack use in common lisp risking stack overflow some lisp control structures are special operators equivalent to other languages syntactic keywords expressions using these operators have the same surface appearance as function calls but differ in that the arguments are not necessarily evaluated or in the case of an iteration expression may be evaluated more than once in contrast to most other major programming languages lisp allows implementing control structures using the language several control structures are implemented as lisp macros and can even be macro expanded by the programmer who wants to know how they work both common lisp and scheme have operators for non local control flow the differences in these operators are some of the deepest differences between the two dialects scheme supports re entrant continuations using the procedure which allows program to save and later restore particular place in execution common lisp does not support re entrant continuations but does support several ways of handling escape continuations often the same algorithm can be expressed in lisp in either an imperative or functional style as noted above scheme tends to favor the functional style using tail recursion and continuations to express control flow however imperative style is still quite possible the style preferred by many common lisp programmers may seem more familiar to programmers used to structured languages such as while that preferred by schemers more closely resembles pure functional languages such as haskell because of lisp early heritage in list processing it has wide array of higher order functions relating to iteration over sequences in many cases where an explicit loop would be needed in other languages like loop in in lisp the same task can be accomplished with higher order function the same is true of many functional programming languages good example is function which in scheme is called and in common lisp is called given function and one or more lists applies the function successively to the lists elements in order collecting the results in new list mapcar this applies the function to each corresponding pair of list elements yielding the result examples here are examples of common lisp code the basic hello world program print hello world lisp syntax lends itself naturally to recursion mathematical problems such as the enumeration of recursively defined sets are simple to express in this notation evaluate number factorial defun factorial if factorial an alternative implementation takes less stack space than the previous version if the underlying lisp system optimizes tail recursion defun factorial optional acc if acc factorial acc contrast with an iterative version which uses common lisp macro defun factorial loop for from to for fac then fac finally return fac the following function reverses list lisp built in reverse function does the same thing defun reverse list let return value dolist list push return value return value object systems various object systems and models have been built on top of alongside

      "Second most similar (Scheme (programming language) at 1425 with 0.9268268346786499): Â«scheme is programming language that supports multiple paradigms including functional and imperative programming it is one of the three main dialects of lisp alongside common lisp and clojure unlike common lisp scheme follows minimalist design philosophy specifying small standard core with powerful tools for language extension scheme was created during the at the mit ai lab and released by its developers guy steele and gerald jay sussman via series of memos now known as the lambda papers it was the first dialect of lisp to choose lexical scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail call optimization giving stronger support for functional programming and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms it was also one of the first programming languages to support first class continuations it had significant influence on the effort that led to the development of common lisp common lisp the language nd ed guy steele jr digital press common lisp is new dialect of lisp successor to maclisp influenced strongly by zetalisp and to some extent by scheme and interlisp the scheme language is standardized in the official ieee standard reaff ieee standard for the scheme programming language ieee part number stdpd unanimously reaffirmed at meeting of the ieee sa standards board standards review committee revcom march item on minutes reaffirmation minutes accessed october note this document is only available for purchase from ieee and is not available online at the time of writing and de facto standard called the revised report on the algorithmic language scheme rnrs the most widely implemented standard is rs new standard rs was ratified in scheme has diverse user base due to its compactness and elegance but its minimalist philosophy has also caused wide divergence between practical implementations so much that the scheme steering committee calls it the world most unportable programming language and family of dialects rather than single language history origins scheme started in the as an attempt to understand carl hewitt actor model for which purpose steele and sussman wrote tiny lisp interpreter using maclisp and then added mechanisms for creating actors and sending messages scheme was originally called schemer in the tradition of other lisp derived languages such as planner or conniver the current name resulted from the authors use of the its operating system which limited filenames to two components of at most six characters each currently schemer is commonly used to refer to scheme programmer rs new language standardization process began at the scheme workshop with the goal of producing an rs standard in this process broke with the earlier rnrs approach of unanimity rs features standard module system allowing split between the core language and libraries number of drafts of the rs specification were released the final version being rs successful vote resulted in the ratification of the new standard announced on august currently the newest releases of various scheme implementations support the rs standard there is portable reference implementation of the proposed implicitly phased libraries for rs called psyntax which loads and bootstraps itself properly on various older scheme implementations feature of rs is the record type descriptor rtd when an rtd is created and used the record type representation can show the memory layout it also calculated object field bit mask and mutable scheme object field bit masks and helped the garbage collector know what to do with the fields without traversing the whole fields list that are saved in the rtd rtd allows users to expand the basic rtd to create new record system rs introduces numerous significant changes to the language the source code is now specified in unicode and large subset of unicode characters may now appear in scheme symbols and identifiers and there are other minor changes to the lexical rules character data is also now specified in unicode many standard procedures have been moved to the new standard libraries which themselves form large expansion of the standard containing procedures and syntactic forms that were formerly not part of the standard new module system has been introduced and systems for exception handling are now standardized syntax rules has been replaced with more expressive syntactic abstraction facility syntax case which allows the use of all of scheme at macro expansion time compliant implementations are now required to support scheme full numeric tower and the semantics of numbers have been expanded mainly in the direction of support for the ieee standard for floating point numerical representation rs the rs standard has caused controversy because it is seen to have departed from the minimalist philosophy in august the scheme steering committee which oversees the standardization process announced its intention to recommend splitting scheme into two languages large modern programming language for programmers and small version subset of the large version retaining the minimalism praised by educators and casual implementors two working groups were created to work on these two new versions of scheme the scheme reports process site has links to the working groups charters public discussions and issue tracking system the ninth draft of rs small language was made available on april vote ratifying this draft closed on may and the final report has been available since august describing the small language of that effort therefore it cannot be considered in isolation as the successor to rs distinguishing features scheme is primarily functional programming language it shares many characteristics with other members of the lisp programming language family scheme very simple syntax is based on expressions parenthesized lists in which prefix operator is followed by its arguments scheme programs thus consist of sequences of nested lists lists are also the main data structure in scheme leading to close equivalence between source code and data formats homoiconicity scheme programs can easily create and evaluate pieces of scheme code dynamically the reliance on lists as data structures is shared by all lisp dialects scheme inherits rich set of list processing primitives such as cons car and cdr from its lisp progenitors scheme uses strictly but dynamically typed variables and supports first class procedures thus procedures can be assigned as values to variables or passed as arguments to procedures this section concentrates mainly on innovative features of the language including those features that distinguish scheme from other lisps unless stated otherwise descriptions of features relate to the rs standard in examples provided in this section the notation result is used to indicate the result of evaluating the expression on the immediately preceding line this is the same convention used in rs fundamental design features this subsection describes those features of scheme that have distinguished it from other programming languages from its earliest days these are the aspects of scheme that most strongly influence any product of the scheme language and they are the aspects that all versions of the scheme programming language from onward share minimalism scheme is very simple language much easier to implement than many other languages of comparable expressive power the scheme implementation is so named because the interpreter was written by richard kelsey and jonathan rees in hours august th th see this ease is attributable to the use of lambda calculus to derive much of the syntax of the language from more primitive forms for instance of the expression based syntactic constructs defined in the rs scheme standard are classed as derived or library forms which can be written as macros involving more fundamental forms principally lambda as rs says rs sec the most fundamental of the variable binding constructs is the lambda expression because all other variable binding constructs can be explained in terms of lambda expressions fundamental forms define lambda quote if define syntax let syntax letrec syntax syntax rules set derived forms do let let letrec cond case and or begin named let delay unquote unquote splicing quasiquote example macro to implement let as an expression using lambda to perform the variable bindings define syntax let syntax rules let var expr body lambda var body expr thus using let as defined above scheme implementation would rewrite let as lambda which reduces implementation task to that of coding procedure instantiations in sussman and steele remarked that the minimalism of scheme was not conscious design goal but rather the unintended outcome of the design process we were actually trying to build something complicated and discovered serendipitously that we had accidentally designed something that met all our goals but was much simpler than we had intended we realized that the lambda calculus small simple formalism could serve as the core of powerful and expressive programming language lexical scope like most modern programming languages and unlike earlier lisps such as maclisp scheme is lexically scoped all possible variable bindings in program unit can be analyzed by reading the text of the program unit without consideration of the contexts in which it may be called this contrasts with dynamic scoping which was characteristic of early lisp dialects because of the processing costs associated with the primitive textual substitution methods used to implement lexical scoping algorithms in compilers and interpreters of the day in those lisps it was perfectly possible for reference to free variable inside procedure to refer to quite distinct bindings external to the procedure depending on the context of the call the impetus to incorporate lexical scoping which was an unusual scoping model in the early into their new version of lisp came from sussman studies of algol he suggested that algol like lexical scoping mechanisms would help to realize their initial goal of implementing hewitt actor model in lisp the key insights on how to introduce lexical scoping into lisp dialect were popularized in sussman and steele lambda paper scheme an interpreter for extended lambda calculus where they adopted the concept of the lexical closure on page which had been described in an ai memo in by joel moses who attributed the idea to peter landin lambda calculus alonzo church mathematical notation the lambda calculus has inspired lisp use of lambda as keyword for introducing procedure as well as influencing the development of functional programming techniques involving the use of higher order functions in lisp but early lisps were not suitable expressions of the lambda calculus because of their treatment of free variables formal lambda system has axioms and complete calculation rule it is helpful for the analysis using mathematical logic and tools in this system calculation can be seen as directional deduction the syntax of lambda calculus follows the recursive expressions from parentheses spaces the period and the symbol the function of lambda calculation includes first serve as starting point of powerful mathematical logic second it can reduce the requirement of programmers to consider the implementation details because it can use for imitate machine evaluation finally the lambda calculation created substantial meta theory the introduction of lexical scope resolved the problem by making an equivalence between some forms of lambda notation and their practical expression in working programming language sussman and steele showed that the new language could be used to elegantly derive all the imperative and declarative semantics of other programming languages including algol and fortran and the dynamic scope of other lisps by using lambda expressions not as simple procedure instantiations but as control structures and environment modifiers they introduced continuation passing style along with their first description of scheme in the first of the lambda papers and in subsequent papers they proceeded to demonstrate the raw power of this practical use of lambda calculus block structure scheme inherits its block structure from earlier block structured languages particularly algol in scheme blocks are implemented by three binding constructs let let and letrec for instance the following construct creates block in which symbol called var is bound to the number define var goose any reference to var here will be bound to goose let var statements go here any reference to var here will be bound to any reference to var here will be bound to goose blocks can be nested to create arbitrarily complex block structures according to the need of the programmer the use of block structuring to create local bindings alleviates the risk of namespace collision that can otherwise occur one variant of let let permits bindings to refer to variables defined earlier in the same construct thus let var var var but the definition of var could not refer to var the other variant letrec is designed to enable mutually recursive procedures to be bound to one another calculation of hofstadter male and female sequences as list of pairs define hofstadter male female letrec female lambda if male female male lambda if female male let loop if cons cons female male loop hofstadter male female see hofstadter male and female sequences for the definitions used in this example all procedures bound in single letrec may refer to one another by name as well as to values of variables defined earlier in the same letrec but they may not refer to values defined later in the same letrec variant of let the named let form has an identifier after the let keyword this binds the let variables to the argument of procedure whose name is the given identifier and whose body is the body of the let form the body may be repeated as desired by calling the procedure the named let is widely used to implement iteration example simple counter let loop if cons loop like any procedure in scheme the procedure created in the named let is first class object proper tail recursion scheme has an iteration construct do but it is more idiomatic in scheme to use tail recursion to express iteration standard conforming scheme implementations are required to optimize tail calls so as to support an unbounded number of active tail calls rs sec property the scheme report describes as proper tail recursion making it safe for scheme programmers to write iterative algorithms using recursive structures which are sometimes more intuitive tail recursive procedures and the named let form provide support for iteration using tail recursion building list of squares from to note loop is simply an arbitrary symbol used as label any symbol will do define list of squares let loop res if res loop cons res list of squares first class continuations continuations in scheme are first class objects scheme provides the procedure call with current continuation also known as call cc to capture the current continuation by packing it up as an escape procedure bound to formal argument in procedure provided by the programmer rs sec first class continuations enable the programmer to create non local control constructs such as iterators coroutines and backtracking continuations can be used to emulate the behavior of return statements in imperative programming languages the following function find first given function func and list lst returns the first element in lst such that func returns true define find first func lst call with current continuation lambda return immediately for each lambda if func return immediately lst find first integer find first zero the following example traditional programmer puzzle shows that scheme can handle continuations as first class objects binding them to variables and passing them as arguments to procedures let yin lambda cc display cc call with current continuation lambda yang lambda cc display cc call with current continuation lambda yin yang when executed this code displays counting sequence shared namespace for procedures and variables in contrast to common lisp all data and procedures in scheme share common namespace whereas in common lisp functions and data have separate namespaces making it possible for function and variable to have the same name and requiring special notation for referring to function as value this is sometimes known as the lisp vs lisp distinction referring to the unified namespace of scheme and the separate namespaces of common lisp in scheme the same primitives that are used to manipulate and bind data can be used to bind procedures there is no equivalent of common lisp defun and primitives variable bound to number define mutation altering the bound value set assigning procedure to the same variable set lambda assigning the result of an expression to the same variable set functional programming apply set lambda map implementation standards this subsection documents design decisions that have been taken over the years which have given scheme particular character but are not the direct outcomes of the original design numerical tower scheme specifies comparatively full set of numerical datatypes including complex and rational types which is known in scheme as the numerical tower rs sec the standard treats these as abstractions and does not commit the implementor to any particular internal representations numbers may have the quality of exactness an exact number can only be produced by sequence of exact operations involving other exact numbers inexactness is thus contagious the standard specifies that any two implementations must produce equivalent results for all operations resulting in exact numbers the rs standard specifies procedures exact inexact and inexact exact which can be used to change the exactness of number inexact exact produces the exact number that is numerically closest to the argument exact inexact produces the inexact number that is numerically closest to the argument the rs standard omits these procedures from the main report but specifies them as rs compatibility procedures in the standard library rnrs rs in the rs standard scheme implementations are not required to implement the whole numerical tower but they must implement coherent subset consistent with both the purposes of the implementation and the spirit of the scheme language rs sec the new rs standard does require implementation of the whole tower and exact integer objects and exact rational number objects of practically unlimited size and precision and to implement certain procedures so they always return exact results when given exact arguments rs sec sec example exact arithmetic in an implementation that supports exact rational complex numbers sum of three rational real numbers and two rational complex numbers define check for exactness exact example same arithmetic in an implementation that supports neither exact rational numbers nor complex numbers but does accept real numbers in rational notation sum of four rational real numbers define xr sum of two rational real numbers define xi xr xi check for exactness exact xr exact xi both implementations conform to the rs standard but the second does not conform to rs because it does not implement the full numerical tower delayed evaluation scheme supports delayed evaluation through the delay form and the procedure force define define eval aplus delay set force eval aplus define eval aplus delay let force eval aplus set force eval aplus the lexical context of the original definition of the promise is preserved and its value is also preserved after the first use of force the promise is only ever evaluated once these primitives which produce or handle values known as promises can be used to implement advanced lazy evaluation constructs such as streams in the rs standard these are no longer primitives but instead are provided as part of the rs compatibility library rnrs rs in rs suggested implementation of delay and force is given implementing the promise as procedure with no arguments thunk and using memoization to ensure that it is only ever evaluated once irrespective of the number of times force is called rs sec srfi enables the expression of both finite and infinite sequences with extraordinary economy for example this is definition of the fibonacci sequence using the functions defined in srfi define the fibonacci sequence define fibs stream cons stream cons stream map fibs stream cdr fibs compute the hundredth number in the sequence stream ref fibs order of evaluation of procedure arguments most lisps specify an order of evaluation for procedure arguments scheme does not order of evaluation including the order in which the expression in the operator position is evaluated may be chosen by an implementation on call by call basis and the only constraint is that the effect of any concurrent evaluation of the operator and operand expressions is constrained to be consistent with some sequential order of evaluation rs sec let ev lambda display evaluating display if procedure procedure newline ev ev ev ev is procedure that describes the argument passed to it then returns the value of the argument in contrast with other lisps the appearance of an expression in the operator position the first item of scheme expression is quite legal as long as the result of the expression in the operator position is procedure in calling the procedure to add and the expressions ev ev and ev may be evaluated in any order as long as the effect is not as if they were evaluated in parallel thus the following three lines may be displayed in any order by standard scheme when the above example code is executed although the text of one line may not be interleaved with another because that would violate the sequential evaluation constraint evaluating evaluating evaluating procedure hygienic macros in the rs standard and also in later reports the syntax of scheme can easily be extended via the macro system the rs standard introduced powerful hygienic macro system that allows the programmer to add new syntactic constructs to the language using simple pattern matching sublanguage rs sec prior to this the hygienic macro system had been relegated to an appendix of the rs standard as high level system alongside low level macro system both of which were treated as extensions to scheme rather than an essential part of the language implementations of the hygienic macro system also called syntax rules are required to respect the lexical scoping of the rest of the language this is assured by special naming and scoping rules for macro expansion and avoids common programming errors that can occur in the macro systems of other programming languages rs specifies more sophisticated transformation system syntax case which has been available as language extension to rs scheme for some time define macro to implement variant of if with multi expression true branch and no false branch define syntax when syntax rules when pred exp exps if pred begin exp exps invocations of macros and procedures bear close resemblance both are expressions but they are treated differently when the compiler encounters an expression in the program it first checks to see if the symbol is defined as syntactic keyword within the current lexical scope if so it then attempts to expand the macro treating the items in the tail of the expression as arguments without compiling code to evaluate them and this process is repeated recursively until no macro invocations remain if it is not syntactic keyword the compiler compiles code to evaluate the arguments in the tail of the expression and then to evaluate the variable represented by the symbol at the head of the expression and call it as procedure with the evaluated tail expressions passed as actual arguments to it most scheme implementations also provide additional macro systems among popular ones are syntactic closures explicit renaming macros and define macro non hygienic macro system similar to defmacro system provided in common lisp the inability to specify whether or not macro is hygienic is one of the shortcomings of the macro system alternative models for expansion such as scope sets provide potential solution environments and eval prior to rs scheme had no standard equivalent of the eval procedure which is ubiquitous in other lisps although the first lambda paper had described evaluate as similar to the lisp function eval and the first revised report in replaced this with enclose which took two arguments the second third and fourth revised reports omitted any equivalent of eval the reason for this confusion is that in scheme with its lexical scoping the result of evaluating an expression depends on where it is evaluated for instance it is not clear whether the result of evaluating the following expression should be or jonathan rees the scheme of things the june meeting postscript in lisp pointers october december retrieved let name let evaluate list name if it is evaluated in the outer environment where name is defined the result is the sum of the operands if it is evaluated in the inner environment where the symbol has been bound to the value of the procedure the result is the product of the two operands rs resolves this confusion by specifying three procedures that return environments and providing procedure eval that takes an expression and an environment and evaluates the expression in the environment provided rs sec rs extends this by providing procedure called environment by which the programmer can specify exactly which objects to import into the evaluation environment treatment of non boolean values in boolean expressions in most dialects of lisp including common lisp by convention the value nil evaluates to the value false in boolean expression in scheme since the ieee standard in all values except including nil equivalent in scheme which is written as evaluate to the value true in boolean expression rs sec where the constant representing the boolean value of true is in most lisps in scheme it is disjointness of primitive datatypes in scheme the primitive datatypes are disjoint only one of the following predicates can be true of any scheme object boolean pair symbol number char string vector port procedure rs sec within the numerical datatype by contrast the numerical values overlap for example an integer value satisfies all of the integer rational real complex and number predicates at the same time rs sec equivalence predicates scheme has three different types of equivalence between arbitrary objects denoted by three different equivalence predicates relational operators for testing equality eq eqv and equal eq evaluates to unless its parameters represent the same data object in memory eqv is generally the same as eq but treats primitive objects characters and numbers specially so that numbers that represent the same value are eqv even if they do not refer to the same object equal compares data structures such as lists vectors and strings to determine if they have congruent structure and eqv contents rs sec type dependent equivalence operations also exist in scheme string and string ci compare two strings the latter performs case independent comparison char and char ci compare characters compares numbers comments up to the rs standard the standard comment in scheme was semicolon which makes the rest of the line invisible to scheme numerous implementations have supported alternative conventions permitting comments to extend for more than single line and the rs standard permits two of them an entire expression may be turned into comment or commented out by preceding it with introduced in srfi and multiline comment or block comment may be produced by surrounding text with and input output scheme input and output is based on the port datatype rs sec rs defines two default ports accessible with the procedures current input port and current output port which correspond to the unix notions of standard input and standard output most implementations also provide current error port redirection of input and standard output is supported in the standard by standard procedures such as with input from file and with output to file most implementations provide string ports with similar redirection capabilities enabling many normal input output operations to be performed on string buffers instead of files using procedures described in srfi the rs standard specifies much more sophisticated and capable port procedures and many new types of port the following examples are written in strict rs scheme example with output defaulting to current output port let hello lambda display hello world newline hello example as but using optional port argument to output procedures let hello lambda display hello world newline hello current output port example as but output is redirected to newly created file nb with output to file is an optional procedure in rs let hello lambda display hello world newline with output to file hello example as but with explicit file open and port close to send output to file let hello lambda display hello world newline output port open output file hello output port close output port output port example as but with using call with output file to send output to file let hello lambda display hello world newline call with output file hello similar procedures are provided for input rs scheme provides the predicates input port and output port for character input and output write char read char peek char and char ready are provided for writing and reading scheme expressions scheme provides read and write on read operation the result returned is the end of file object if the input port has reached the end of the file and this can be tested using the predicate eof object in addition to the standard srfi defines basic formatting procedure resembling common lisp format function after which it is named redefinition of standard procedures in scheme procedures are bound to variables at rs the language standard formally mandated that programs may change the variable bindings of built in procedures effectively redefining them rs language changes for example one may extend to accept strings as well as numbers by redefining it set let original lambda args apply if or null args string car args string append original args in rs every binding including the standard ones belongs to some library and all exported bindings are immutable rs sec because of this redefinition of standard procedures by mutation is forbidden instead it is possible to import different procedure under the name of standard one which in effect is similar to redefinition nomenclature and naming conventions in standard scheme procedures that convert from one datatype to another contain the character string in their name predicates end with and procedures that change the value of already allocated data end with these conventions are often followed by scheme programmers in formal contexts such as scheme standards the word procedure is used in preference to function to refer to lambda expression or primitive procedure in normal usage the words procedure and function are used interchangeably procedure application is sometimes referred to formally as combination as in other lisps the term thunk is used in scheme to refer to procedure with no arguments the term proper tail recursion refers to the property of all scheme implementations that they perform tail call optimization so as to support an indefinite number of active tail calls the form of the titles of the standards documents since rs revisedn report on the algorithmic language scheme is reference to the title of the algol standard document revised report on the algorithmic language algol the summary page of rs is closely modeled on the summary page of the algol report review of standard forms and procedures the language is formally defined in the standards rs and rs they describe standard forms keywords and accompanying syntax which provide the control structure of the language and standard procedures which perform common tasks standard forms this table describes the standard forms in scheme some forms appear in more than one row because they cannot easily be classified into single function in the language forms marked in this table are classed as derived library forms in the standard and are often implemented as macros using more fundamental forms in practice making the task of implementation much easier than in other languages standard forms in the

number implementations of and that take more than two arguments are defined but left optional at rs scheme requests for implementation because of scheme minimalism many common procedures and syntactic forms are not defined by the standard in order to keep the core language small but facilitate standardization of extensions the scheme community has scheme request for implementation srfi process by which extension libraries are defined through careful discussion of extension proposals this promotes code portability many of the srfis are supported by all or most scheme implementations srfis with fairly wide support in different implementations include feature based conditional expansion construct list library homogeneous numeric vector datatypes basic string ports receive binding to multiple

program argument processor parameter objects streams eager comprehensions vector library primitives for expressing iterative lazy algorithms integers as bits more general cond clause octet vectors compare procedures implementations the elegant minimalist design has made scheme popular target for language designers hobbyists and educators and because of its small size that of typical interpreter it is also popular choice for embedded systems and scripting this has resulted in scores of implementations known implementations of scheme are listed by most of which differ from each other so much that porting programs from one implementation to another is quite difficult and the small size of the standard language means that writing useful program of any great complexity in standard portable scheme is almost impossible the rs standard specifies much broader language in an attempt to broaden its appeal to programmers almost all implementations provide traditional lisp style read eval print loop for development and debugging many also compile scheme programs to executable binary support for embedding scheme code in programs written in other languages is also common as the relative simplicity of scheme implementations makes it popular choice for adding scripting capabilities to larger systems developed in languages such as the gambit chicken and bigloo scheme interpreters compile scheme to which makes embedding particularly easy in addition bigloo compiler can be configured to generate jvm bytecode and it also features an experimental bytecode generator for net some implementations support additional features for example kawa and jscheme provide integration with java classes and the scheme to compilers often make it easy to use external libraries written in up to allowing the embedding of actual code in the scheme source another example is pvts which offers set of visual tools for supporting the learning of scheme chez scheme is notable example for individual type of implementation of scheme it was created by kent dybvig in chez scheme includes completely different implementation of scheme which could replace some of the functions of racket chez scheme has relatively different core part in distribution as result the application of chez scheme can make every racket runs magically fast usage scheme is widely used by number of schools in particular number
